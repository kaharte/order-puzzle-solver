# order-puzzle-solver
This is a Python file for solving order puzzles, like this one below:

It cannot solve puzzles that include clues such as 'X was not in last place', 'Y was in third', or 'A was not next to B or C.' All clues have to be in the format of 'A was in front of B' or 'B was behind C'. If clues contain more than one piece of information, such as 'A was in front of B and C', it would have to be broken down into two separate clues: 'A was in front of B' and 'A was in front of C'.

This program is very clunky to use, but it does seem to work. I made this to give myself some coding practice, and hopefully someday I'll be able to revisit it and make some improvements.
